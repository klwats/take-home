# NewsReader
## Abstract
NewsReader is a news app that presents the user with today's top news stories. It also allows them to select news stories from seven different categories.
## Project Background
This web application was developed for the Turing School of Software and Design's Mod 4 Take-Home project. Students were asked to design and create an app in 8 hours. We were provided with very few requirements: 

- A list of articles (headline, image, description if present, date)
- A “detailed” view for each article (headline, image, date, content, source)
- Articles in the list must link to a detailed article view within your app (linking to the source website does not fulfill this requirement)
- Some sort of search, filter, OR sort

News data for the project was accessed from the public [News API](https://newsapi.org/). 
## Technologies
  - JavaScript
  - React
  - CSS & HTML
  - Webpack module bundler
  - Postman (for API request testing)
  - GitHub
  - Miro for wireframing

## Reflections
### Wins
I did not initially think I would be able to design and build an app in 8 hours. I had a timer running throughout the project and was very impressed with myself when I had a fully functioning app in that time frame!

### Challenges, Lessons Learned & Potential Improvements
I learned the importance of asking clarifying questions at the beginning, even if you're 95% sure you are correct! I also learned the importance of fully reviewing the API endpoints prior to designing the project. There is a lot of room for improvement with the CSS but I chose to prioritize functionality over design, given the time restraints.
